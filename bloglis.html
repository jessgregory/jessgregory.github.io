      <h3> Nov. 4, 2020 </h3>
        <p> Yesterday was Election day for the 2020 Presidential Election! I had voted early in-person so I did not have to flock to the polls and wait in lines. Instead, I spent my day preparing for my evening radio broadcast of election coverage with my co-host Tatiana Jordan. At 8:00 a.m. in the morning, Program Director Max interviewed Mayor Pete Buttigieg. I arrived at the radio station an hour before to prep Max and ease his nerves. That afternoon, I discussed the importance of voting and enacting legislation that ensures LGBTQ+ students' safety in schools with Rep. Mark Pocan. On Monday, I had the honor of interviewing Senator Elizabeth Warren! I thought she had an amazing run in the 2020 Presidential Race, so it was incredible to talk with her about the Biden administration's policies. </p>

      <h3>Oct. 31, 2020</h3>
        <p> This year I didn't feel like dressing up for Halloween. Usually I have a difficult time deciding who/what to dress up as, but this year especially. Because of COVID-19, I knew I would not be going to any parties so it didn't feel worth it to spend money on a costume. Instead, my boyfriend Teddy and I along with our friend Jack made a delicious, elaborate dinner. I contributed by making bacon-wrapped jalapeno poppers in Jack's air fryer while he cooked up some steak. As entry-level cooks, it took us the entire night to prepare and eat our meals. While it was not a typical Halloween evening, it was nevertheless memorable! </p>
