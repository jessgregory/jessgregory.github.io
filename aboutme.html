      <p> Hi there! Thank you for taking the time to view my site to learn more about me and my work. I’m a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the School of Journalism, double tracking in Strategic Communications and Broadcast. I graduated from New London High School in May 2018 and I grew up in its neighboring town of Hortonville, Wisconsin. I have two little brothers that I enjoy playing video games with. I’m a creative person; since a young age I’ve been playing piano, exploring music, travelling to national parks, reading and writing. In my free time, you’ll likely find me at a local coffee shop with friends or at a concert. </p>
