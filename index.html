      <h3>Art of Sound: Hamel Music Center</h3>
      <p> Many journalism students have a special interest in a particular topic. I love writing about music! And listening to it, of course. Sometimes even both at once. For a past project, I investigated the newly opened Hamel Music Center on University Avenue in Madison, Wisconsin. I compiled my works into a website that can be accessed <a href="http://artofsoundhamelmusic.wordpress.com">here</a> </p>
