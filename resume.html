      <h3> Overview </h3>
      </p> My resume was last updated Nov. 11, 2020. The document compiles my high school and college GPAs, campus involvement, skills, career-related experience and previous employers. I am a third-year student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying Reporting, Strategic Communications, and Digital Studies. For a career, I am most interested in being an Investigative Reporter or a Public Relations manager. Within my major, there are many applicable career tracks.</p>

       <p> As of August 2020, I am employed as News Director at UW-Madison's student radio station, WSUM 91.7 FM. I’m looking forward to all of the great stories and content I’ll be crafting in the future! If you have any story ideas or leads, please email me or contact me on my socials.</p>
